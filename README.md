## Estimating the false finding rate across scientific fields  
  
This repository contains code for analyses related to the article "Estimating the false finding rate across scientific fields"  
  
The file false_finding_rate_analysis.Rmd is an R markdown file which makes a pdf document with text and figures describing the analysis. This file contains all analysis code. (Note: while this analysis is still in a preliminary phase the analysis .Rmd file can be found under "drafts" along with the pdf produced by the .Rmd file)  
   
The files plos.csl and false_finding_rate_v2.bib are used my the .Rmd file for formatting and references, but aren't used in the actual analysis.  
  
All data used for the analysis is either generated by the .Rmd file (for simulations) is automatically downloaded from publically available data by the .Rmd file from references cited in the text, or is hard-coded in the file from data extracted manually from references cited in the text.  
  
To run the analysis, the core .Rmd file along with the .csl and .bib files should be placed in a folder together. This can be accomplished by downloading this repository. Then, knitting the .Rmd file should produce the pdf results.
